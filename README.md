# Ortelius TOC

The role of the Ortelius Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) is to facilitate communication and collaboration across the Ortelius committers. The TOC will be responsible for:

1) coordinating collaboration among Ortelius milestones, including development of an overall technical vision for the community;

2) making recommendations for architectual and process updates;

3) electing annually a chairperson to preside over meetings, set the agenda for meetings, ensure meeting minutes are taken and who will also serve on the Governing Board as the TOCâ€™s representative (the "TOC Representative");

4) creating, maintaining and amending project lifecycle procedures and processes, subject to the approval of the Governing Board; and

5) such other matters related to the technical role of the TOC as may be communicated to the TOC by the Governing Board.

# TOC Configuration
The size of the TOC will be determined by the Ortelius Governing Board, starting with a minimum of 5 members. Each member will serve for 2 years with no term limits. The elected members of the TOC will nominate a TOC Chairperson to chair the board meetings which includes calling for votes. The TOC will meet a minimum of 4 times per year.

# Voting
In various situations the Ortelius TOC shall hold a vote. Voting can occur when there is a majority attendance. These votes can happen in person, remote meetings, phone, email, or via a voting service, when appropriate. TOC members can either respond "agree, yes, +1", "disagree, no, -1", or "abstain", 0. A vote passes with a majority vote of votes cast. An abstain vote equals not voting at all.
